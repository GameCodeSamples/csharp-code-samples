Overall, this interactions system provides a flexible and customizable way to create interactive objects in the game, without having to write complex interaction logic from scratch.

It can look a bit complex but is due to the Design requirements (better explained by the diagrams below) and the fact that this is for an online game and the networking replications always add a layer of complexity.

The good part of this system is that once the base system is done, there is only the need to implement specific new actions and conditions, so it is easier to create new content.
